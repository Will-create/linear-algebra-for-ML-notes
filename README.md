## Introduction  

Welcome to **Linear Algebra for Machine Learning**!  

This repository contains comprehensive notes that cover everything you need to know about linear algebra as it applies to machine learning. Linear algebra is a foundational subject in ML, providing the mathematical framework for understanding concepts like vectors, matrices, transformations, and optimization.  

These notes are designed to be clear, structured, and educational, making them useful for learners at all levels. As I progress through the course, I will update this repository with well-organized explanations, formulas, and examples.  

Stay tuned for more! ðŸš€
