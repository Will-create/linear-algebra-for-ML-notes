## Introduction  

Welcome to **Linear Algebra for Machine Learning**!  

This repository contains comprehensive notes that cover everything you need to know about linear algebra as it applies to machine learning. Linear algebra is a foundational subject in ML, providing the mathematical framework for understanding concepts like vectors, matrices, transformations, and optimization.  

These notes are designed to be clear, structured, and educational, making them useful for learners at all levels. As I progress through the course, I will update this repository with well-organized explanations, formulas, and examples.  

Stay tuned for more! ðŸš€  



## Assumed Prerequisites  

Before diving into these notes, we assume that you already have a basic understanding of linear algebra concepts, typically covered in a **bachelor's degree** or a **third-year university course**. This means you should be familiar with:  

- **Basic Algebra and Functions** â€“ Understanding operations on numbers and functions.  
- **Vectors and Scalars** â€“ Concept of vectors, scalars, and their basic operations.  
- **Matrix Operations** â€“ Addition, multiplication, transposition, and inverses of matrices.  
- **Determinants and Rank** â€“ Computing determinants and understanding the rank of a matrix.  
- **Linear Systems of Equations** â€“ Solving equations using Gaussian elimination or matrix methods.  

If you need a refresher on these topics, consider reviewing a linear algebra textbook or an introductory course before proceeding.
